* Overview
This README contains documentation on the code used in my MSc Thesis project.
- contains

- all code packaged as a pip package split into two main sub modules relating to specific functionality
  + Dataset synthesis
  + General utility (plots paths)

*Notes*
*It should be noted that difficulty was faced installing both NILMTK and NILMTK-contrib and though an anaconda installation appears to be the best supported approach, this package was not found to work on Manjaro Linux =5.15.50-1=. These packages were instead installed using =pip=, however this approach incurred several dependency problems which the =NILMTK-contrib= package, which were only fixed by editing the package source. A full write-up of the approach used for this work is included in [[file:../guides/nilmtk_install_guide.org][this guide]].

**The author's fork of the NILMTK is used in this work which includes several improvements in the way in which the experimentation API records result. These changes were necessitated by the large number of data-points generated by the parameter sweeps used in this work. These changes are non breaking and have been build with reintegration into NILMTK in mind. Full documentation of these changes can be found in the repository itself.
