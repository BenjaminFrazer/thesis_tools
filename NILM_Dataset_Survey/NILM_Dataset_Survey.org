* Survey Overview
I initially conducted this survey of existing NILM datasets to find a suitable dataset to run NILM experiments on heat pumps, however I was unable to find anything that fit my purposes. Since many of the metrics will be broadly applicable to any NILM research, I have chosen to make a summary of my findings available, allong with some notes on each dataset where relevant.

The IDEAL Household Energy Dataset comprises data from 255 UK homes. Alongside electric and gas data from each home the corpus contains individual room temperature and humidity readings and temperature readings from the boiler. For 39 of the 255 homes more detailed data is available, including individual electrical appliance use data, and data on individual radiators. Sensor data is augmented by anonymised survey data and metadata including occupant demographics, self-reported energy awareness and attitudes, and building, room and appliance characteristics.

#+begin_quote
DRED (Dutch Residential Energy Dataset) is the first open-access, publicly available dataset from The Netherlands. Our deployment consists of several sensors measuring electricity, occupants occupancy and ambient parameters in a household. The data was collected over a period of 6 months from 5th July to 5th December 2015. The DRED dataset includes:
- Electricity monitoring - aggregated energy consumption and appliance level energy consumption.
- Ambient information - room-level indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, environmental parameters (wind speed, humidity, precipitation).
- Occupancy information - room-level location information of occupants, WiFi and BT RSSI information for localization
- Household information - house layout, number of appliance monitored, appliance::location mapping, etc.

As a university member of dataport, Pecan Street has provided access to static time-series datasets (1-second energy, 1-minute energy, and 15-minute energy) for 25 homes from three of our research regions (New York, California, Austin). The data provided for the New York region contains 6 months of data with 100% completeness across all intervals for 25 individual homes. The California region data has 99% completeness for 23 homes for 1-minute and 15-minute data. We started collecting 1-second data for California this year which will be made available at a later date. The data collected from Austin Texas area contains 99% completeness across all intervals for 25 homes.

** Description
From =beckelECODataSet2014=:
#+begin_quote
The ECO data set is a comprehensive data set for non-intrusive load monitoring and occupancy detection research. It was collected in 6 Swiss households over a period of 8 months. For each of the households, the ECO data set provides:

    1 Hz aggregate consumption data. Each measurement contains data on current, voltage, and phase shift for each of the three phases in the household.
    1 Hz plug-level data measured from selected appliances.
    Occupancy information measured through a tablet computer (manual labeling) and a passive infrared sensor (in some of the households).
